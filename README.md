# BellaBeat Project
Bellabeat data analysis project! In this project, I performed many real-world tasks of a junior data
analyst.I worked on a project for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and
met different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions,I follow the steps of the
data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
